AccessSpecifier
======================
it is used for to access the members of a class from one class to another class
private : it is an accessspecifier.
we can apply these word for variable , functions.
We can access these members within a class.
we cannot access these members without inheritance and with inheritnce
classes.
protected:
we can apply these word for variable , functions.
we can access these members within a class, with inheritance , without inheritance,
within a package , other package with inheritance .
public:
it is an accessspecifier.
we can apply these word for variable , functions,classes
we can access these members within a class, with inheritance , without inheritance,
within a package , other package with inheritance ,without inheritance.
default(it is not a keyword):
we are not applying any keyword . then we can access the members
within a class, withinheritance , withoutinhertiance
but within a package.

Inheritance is one of the key features of Object Oriented Programming. Inheritance provided mechanism that allowed a class to inherit property of another class.
In other words, Inheritance in Java is a process where a child class acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent class. The existing class is called parent class and the new class is called child class.
Real Time Example : In the real world, a child inherits the features of its parents such as the beauty of mother and intelligence of father .
Using extends keyword  we need to implement the inheritance concepts
Types of inheritance :
A) java supports only single inheritance with class
1)single : types of single inheritance  1) single 2)Multilevel 3)herirachal
a)single : subclass inherit the features of one superclass
Ex:
class A
{
}
class B extends A
{
}
	
b) Java doesn't support multiple inheritance with class .
we need to use through interface keyword.
2)Multiple : types of multiple inheritance 1) hybrid 2)multiple 3)multipath
Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship, also known as a parent-child relationship.
